    <h3>Happy 16th Monthsary, Mi Estrella</h3> 
    <body> 
    &nbsp
    <p>In you, my love, I have found,</p> 
    <p>A heart that beats with a gentle sound,</p>
    <p>Your touch is like the softest breeze,</p>
    <p>That brings me to my knees.</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>Your smile, like the rising sun,</p>
    <p>Brings warmth to me, and everyone,</p>
    <p>Your eyes, like the stars above,</p> 
    <p>Shine with the light of your love.</p> 
    &nbsp
    <p>Your voice, like a lullaby,</p>
    <p>Soothes me, as it gently sighs,</p>
    <p>Your laugh, like a melody,</p>
    <p>Fills my heart with sweet harmony.</p> 
    &nbsp
    <p>In every moment that we share,</p>
    <p>I find a love that's beyond compare,</p> 
    <p>And in your arms, I am home,</p>
    <p>Never again to be alone.</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>For you are my heart, my soul, my all,</p> 
    <p>The one I'll cherish, until the final call,</p>
    <p>And every day, my love will grow,</p> 
    <p>In ways that only you will know.</p>
